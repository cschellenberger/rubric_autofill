Rubric Autofill Instructions
===========================

This tool helps you quickly fill out Brightspace rubric criteria from a CSV file using automated keystrokes.

How to Use:
-----------
1. Open Brightspace and navigate to the rubric you want to fill in. Place your cursor in the FIRST criterion label field.
2. Run the program (either the .exe or the Python script).
3. When prompted, select your CSV file (e.g., rubric_test.csv) containing the rubric data.
4. Click 'Start' in the dialog. The script will automatically fill in each field and move through the rubric using keyboard shortcuts.
5. Wait for the process to complete. A message will appear when done.

CSV Format:
-----------
- Each row in the CSV should have exactly 7 columns:
    1. Criterion label
    2. Standard 1
    3. Standard 2
    4. Standard 3
    5. Feedback 1
    6. Feedback 2
    7. Feedback 3
- See rubric_test.csv for an example.

Tips:
-----
- Do not use your mouse or keyboard while the script is running, as it will send keystrokes automatically.
- If you need to stop, close the program or press ESC (if running from Python, use Ctrl+C in the terminal).
- For best results, use the default timing settings. If you experience issues, try increasing the delays in the script.

Troubleshooting:
----------------
- If the script does not paste correctly, make sure your Brightspace window is active and the cursor is in the correct field before starting.
- If you see an error about the number of columns, check your CSV for blank lines or missing fields.
